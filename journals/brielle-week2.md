# Week 2 Journal: Brielle Purnell

## Challenges Faced This Week
I had to quarantine at my parents' house this week and I had poor Internet connection for the majority of the time. It was difficult to research, collaborate, and make any progress with this difficulty alone. Next week I'll be able to return to my home setup, so this problem should not persist.  
Therefore, not much notable progress on this project on my end. In terms of the entire project, the Online Store and Order API has the fundamentals. I also added the commit link from Week 1 to the Week 1 journal after realizing this should be done.

## Next Steps
The next steps will be integrating the Order part of the code with the Cashier's App of the project and adding Rewards to the Online Store. I plan on having better progress for next week's checkup.
