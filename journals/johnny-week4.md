# Johnny Vu Week 4 Journal
Due to work from other classes, I wasn't able to get much done this week. I finished the backoffice html but ive decided to revisit it and keep editing it. No changes will be committed as of this time. I will also move towards working on the database again.

Moving forward, I will try to manage my time better with all my other classes.
