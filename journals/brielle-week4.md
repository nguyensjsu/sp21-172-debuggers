# Week 4 Journal: Brielle Purnell

This week I ran into some confusion of the details of the assignment after realizing I was thinking of this project differently from others in my group. Under the Cashier's App part of the Project page, it sounds like the cashier should have a user interface similar to the Starbucks online menu like this:
![starbucks-menu](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-debuggers/blob/main/journals/brielle-images/starbucks-menu.png?raw=true)
However, is this menu style better suited in the Online Store, or is the Online Store only for this: "Customers manage their Starbucks Cards, View Rewards from us, and add Credit Card Payment to load their Starbucks Cards". This sentence makes it sound like customers won't be buying anything from the online store.  
Since the cashiers handle Orders, I will collaborate with my group to connect the Cashier App UI with my Order API.
