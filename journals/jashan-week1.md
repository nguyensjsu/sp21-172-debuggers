Jashan Dhillon week 1 journal
I started to work on the cashiers app, followed old lab examples made sure to include name of the person who will be ordering, if they have an account that would also be accountted for, their rewards if they do have any. Eventually I want the cashier to be able to even use rewards to pay for the drink. Some hiccups in the way include payless ordering and customization. Still trying to figure out how to make payless ordering a thing with this app and how would I store data from the order from it. And customization is also an issue because we would first have to build our menu and then do more research on how to customize the drinks. As of right now I want to implement the size of the drinks and the prices as soon as possible.
