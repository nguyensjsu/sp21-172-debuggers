Jashan Dhillon week 1 journal
I started to work on the code for a simple sign on page. Want to create a sign-on for users because the user should be able to sign in and check their rewards and account information. Since we don't have much created for front end and no database, I used similar techniques from lab 4 to have a sign-in and build around that in the future. The sign-in would work with all the test users in the file. Some hiccups in the way are that its difficult to store the user information at the moment with no database set up. With more meetings with the group we will be able to implement this with in the application. I at first worked on the a cashiers database to store the information that the cashier needs. https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-debuggers/pull/2#issue-620587110, Then after a meeting with the group we decied its not best to do that at the moment, and I then decided to do the sign-in. Under this pull request https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-debuggers/pull/3#issue-620619542. Major problems were communication and no straight plan, after meeting with the group we now have tasks and are able to work better and now have a better idea on this.
I also took initiative, created folders for weekly task board images and journals for the use of my team-mates.
