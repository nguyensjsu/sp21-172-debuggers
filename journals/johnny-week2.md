# Johnny Vu Week 2 Journal
From the previous week, I continued to work on the database to store the customer's information. I encountered many problems in which my code did not work or eventually could not hold the information correctly.

For now, I will continue to watch videos and learn about the databases before coming back to it. Instead, I moved my efforts towards working on the Back Office Help Desk. I had initially laid out the requirements that were needed for this part, such as the rewards credits, cutomer's information, etc. This will require the database in order for the app to access that information. I started to work on the html and encountered some problems there as well. I am familiar with working on html but I haven't made one from scratch. This took a lot of time to revise and edit certain parts without knowing what I wanted. Below, I madea a rough draft of what the back office might look like for their users. I wanted to make the core functions before focusing my efforts somewhere else.
