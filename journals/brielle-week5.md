# Week 4 Journal: Brielle Purnell

This week my API was added to the main working code. I worked on the Cashier's App view and controller. 

## Fixed Console Output
The first thing I did this week was fix the console output for creating an order.

Before, it did not include the id, total, or status of the order. I did this by rearranging a few lines of code.

## Created the Receipt
I created the Receipt portion of the Cashier's App.

I added all of the order's details as model attributes and grabbed them using th:text attributes to display them on the UI. I also added a double lined border around the receipt for a more professional look.
