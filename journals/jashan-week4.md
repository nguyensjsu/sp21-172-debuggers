For this week I was able to start working on the serverside of the cashiers application, I was able to create a Cashiers command that took in variables needed. The variables were the size,type of milk, drink and name of the order. One difficulty I had was the overall though process when it came to this. Is the cashiers command different from the order command? We will figure this out as a group this weekend and either merge the order and casier that we have or use both seperatly
