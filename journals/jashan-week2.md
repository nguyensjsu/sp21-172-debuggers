Jashan Week 2 Journal
For this week, I started to work on the cashiers view. Major difficulty I faced was that I am not very comfortable when it comes to html. So I had to learn the basics and then I used the html files provided to us in the gumball labs and did my own adjustments. I used online resources to learn and understand the html code in order to make my own adjustments. https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-debuggers/tree/main/starbucks_app/Cashiershtml this is the link to my html commit and it has the get order, place order and clear order buttons. Still need to figure out how to create and display orders on the screen. I added in A starbucks logo as well. I had an issue where the image would not show up but I had to make sure that the image was in the same direwctory as the html file in order for it to show on the screen.We also held another meeting to ensure we are on track and everyone knows what they are supposed to do.
This weeks card is below and it shows that I worked on the cashiers app the view of it.
