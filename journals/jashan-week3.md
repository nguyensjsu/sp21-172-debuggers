For this week due to midterms and other work I was only able to to update the cashiers html. The Cashiers html can now have the drink name, the type of milk wanted, the name of the customer and the size of the drink. For the future I want to use a css file, because I am not completly adapt to use it. And have all the drink names, sizes, milk types validated on the server end. Here is the commit link https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-debuggers/commit/27147ae310286a004acda46e8eb039bd6cc4d127
The issue I faced was how to get the texts all centered and how to make the image above the inputs, I did my research online and it showed that I had to reformat how I placed the code. The card worked on was the same as last weeks. ![alt text](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/sp21-172-debuggers/blob/main/Weekly%20cards/Jashan-week2-card.png)
As of right now it seems all the views are taken care of and for this upcoming week we need to code the java side and connect it in order for it to be a fully functioning app
