Week 1 journal - Zeyu Cheng

this week I worked on the online Store & BackOffice Help Desk UI, the page can go to add card, add money by using a vaild credit card, delete and manage the Starbucks card. The Challenge for me is the page switch by click. I made all the pages together. So there is only one html file for this part, when user click the button, the page stay same, the div in different area will change display type to none or block. it can shows exact object that user want to  use. I take some reasearch on the switching div in the same page, and for now it works fine. Next step for me is adding verification credit card backend. and try to connect the UI and backend together.
