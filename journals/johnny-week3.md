# Johnny Vu Week 3 Journal
For this week, I continued to work on the html of the back office. I created a separate page for the service workers to use. As shown below, I made a simple design and I tried to match it with similar colors. As of right now, the buttons on the page don't lead anywhere. That can be managed when we gather everyone's work together and start merging all of our files.

As for this week, I will continue to improve on my design however I can. However, with multriple deadlines approaching, I won't be able to be as productive as I would have hoped to be.
