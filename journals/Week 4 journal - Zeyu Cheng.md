Week 4 journal - Zeyu Cheng

this week I still worked on the online Store & BackOffice Help Desk backend, I did some research and have more understanding on Thymeleaf. I connect the Payment Vaildation with the font-end, and separated the UI into serveral HTML files, because it will be easy to test the functions and use URL route to distinguish the functions. Also for page switch. This part is not that hard, the really tough part is the GetMapping with Pathvarable, I still do not know how to transport data to back-end with /{num}, I all most spend the whole week on this part, but still cannot figure it out. After this I will down the online Store part. and I can try to connect with the code other members done.
