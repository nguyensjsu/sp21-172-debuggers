# Week 3 Journal: Brielle Purnell

## Challenges Faced This Week
I didn't manage my time as I should've this week as I did not make any more progress on the project. I was really slammed on exams, tying up my senior project, and other school work. Now that the week is over and not much time is left for this assignment, I will float this project higher up on my priorities list and try harder to make some progress.
